# My-Vault-of-Stuff

This is the ultimate vault of my stuff. Feel free to use this stuff, but please tell me if you are using it for commercial use. Also, if you are doing AP CS, these projects will most likely be of a large help to you. I will have some face detection and object detection projects on here, as well as some other, more easy projects. I will also have some machine learning/data science stuff on here, so that will be a large help.

I have many personal accomplishments, and have attended one of the best universities in the world. You can be assured that when I do add new code, no matter how sparse the release date is(I have a job), I will always have high quality projects for yor use.

Best wishes,
  GSR
